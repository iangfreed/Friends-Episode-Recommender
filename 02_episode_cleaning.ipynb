He\\'s just some guy\\nI work with!\\n\\nJoey: C\\'mon, you\\'re going out with the guy! There\\'s\\ngotta be something wrong with him!\\n\\nChandler: All right Joey, be\\nnice.\\xa0 So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\\n\\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\\n\\n(They all stare, bemused.)\\n\\nPhoebe: Just, \\'cause, I don\\'t want her to go through\\nwhat I went through with Carl- oh!\\n\\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a\\ndate. It\\'s just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\\n\\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\\n\\n[Time Lapse]\\n\\nChandler: Alright, so I\\'m back in high school, I\\'m\\nstanding in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\\n\\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\\n\\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there\\'s a\\nphone... there.\\n\\nJoey: Instead of...?\\n\\nChandler: That\\'s right.\\n\\nJoey: Never had that dream.\\n\\nPhoebe: No.\\n\\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring.\\nNow I don\\'t know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. \\n\\nMonica: And they weren\\'t looking at\\nyou before?!\\n\\nChandler: Finally, I figure\\nI\\'d better answer it, and it turns out it\\'s my mother,\\nwhich is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\\n\\n[Time Lapse, Ross has entered.]\\n\\nRoss: (mortified) Hi.\\n\\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\\n\\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\\n\\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my\\nthroat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my\\nneck...\\n\\nChandler: Cookie?\\n\\nMonica: (explaining to the others) Carol moved her\\nstuff out today. \\n\\nJoey: Ohh.\\n\\nMonica: (to Ross) Let me get you some coffee.\\n\\nRoss: Thanks.\\n\\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh! (She starts to pluck at the air\\njust in front of Ross.)\\n\\nRoss: No, no don\\'t! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just\\nleave my aura alone, okay?\\n\\nPhoebe: Fine!\\xa0 Be murky!\\n\\nRoss: I\\'ll be fine,\\nalright? Really, everyone. I hope she\\'ll be very happy.\\n\\nMonica: No you don\\'t.\\n\\nRoss: No I don\\'t, to hell with her, she left me!\\n\\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\\n\\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on\\nthat? She didn\\'t know, how should I know?\\n\\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... (They\\nall stare at him.) Did I say that out loud?\\n\\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night,\\nthey seemed to take it pretty well.\\n\\nMonica: Oh really, so that\\nhysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I\\'ll never have\\ngrandchildren, I\\'ll never have grandchildren.\" was what?\\xa0 A wrong number?\\n\\nRoss: Sorry.\\n\\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You\\'re feeling a lot of\\npain right now. You\\'re angry. You\\'re hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\\n\\n(Ross gestures his consent.)\\n\\nJoey: Strip joint! C\\'mon, you\\'re single! Have some\\nhormones!\\n\\nRoss: I don\\'t want to be single, okay? I just... I\\njust- I just wanna be married again!\\n\\n(Rachel enters in a wet wedding dress and starts to search\\nthe room.)\\n\\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars! (He\\nextends his hand hopefully.)\\n\\nMonica: Rachel?!\\n\\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to\\nyour building and you weren\\'t there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be\\nhere and you are, you are!\\n\\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\\n\\nMonica: (pointing at Rachel) De-caff. (to All) Okay,\\neverybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. (to Rachel) This is everybody,\\nthis is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? \\n\\nRachel: Hi, sure!\\n\\nRoss: Hi. \\n\\n(They go to hug but Ross\\'s umbrella opens.\\xa0 He sits\\nback down defeated again.\\xa0 A moment of silence follows as Rachel sits and the others\\nexpect her to explain.)\\n\\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting\\nfor four wet bridesmaids?\\n\\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour\\nbefore the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was\\nlooking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden-\\n(to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet \\'n\\' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned\\non by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that\\'s when it\\nhit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y\\'know, I mean, I always knew looked\\nfamiliar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering \\'Why am I\\ndoing this, and who am I doing this for?\\'. (to Monica) So anyway I just didn\\'t know where\\nto go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you\\'re the only person I\\nknew who lived here in the city.\\n\\nMonica: Who wasn\\'t invited to the wedding.\\n\\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn\\'t be an\\nissue... [Scene: Monica\\'s Apartment, everyone is there and watching a Spanish Soap on TV\\nand are trying to figure out what is going on.]\\n\\nMonica: Now I\\'m guessing that he bought her the big\\npipe organ, and she\\'s really not happy about it. \\n\\nChandler: (imitating the characters)\\nTuna or egg salad?\\xa0 Decide!\\n\\nRoss: (in a deep voice) I\\'ll have\\nwhatever Christine is having.\\n\\nRachel: (on phone) Daddy, I just... I can\\'t marry\\nhim! I\\'m sorry. I just don\\'t love him. Well, it matters to me! \\n\\n(The scene on TV has changed to show two\\nwomen, one is holding her hair.)\\n\\nPhoebe:\\xa0 If I let go of\\nmy hair, my head will fall off. \\n\\nChandler: (re TV) Ooh, she should not be wearing\\nthose pants. \\n\\nJoey: I say push her down the stairs. \\n\\nPhoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:\\xa0\\nPush her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\\n\\n(She is pushed down the stairs and everyone cheers.)\\n\\nRachel: C\\'mon Daddy, listen to me! It\\'s like, it\\'s\\nlike, all of my life, everyone has always told me, \\'You\\'re a shoe! You\\'re a shoe, you\\'re a\\nshoe, you\\'re a shoe!\\'. And today I just stopped and I said, \\'What if I don\\'t wanna be a\\nshoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y\\'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I\\'m not saying I want you\\nto buy me a hat, I\\'m saying I am a ha- It\\'s a metaphor, Daddy!\\n\\nRoss: You can see where he\\'d have trouble.\\n\\nRachel: Look Daddy, it\\'s my life. Well maybe I\\'ll\\njust stay here with Monica. \\n\\nMonica: Well, I guess we\\'ve established who\\'s\\nstaying here with Monica...\\n\\nRachel: Well, maybe that\\'s my decision. Well, maybe\\nI don\\'t need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\\n\\n[Time Lapse, Rachel is breating into a paper bag.]\\n\\nMonica: Just breathe, breathe.. that\\'s it. Just try\\nto think of nice calm things...\\n\\nPhoebe: (sings) Raindrops on roses and rabbits and\\nkittens, (Rachel and Monica turn to look at her.) bluebells and sleighbells and- something\\nwith mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with\\nstring.\\xa0 These are a few...\\n\\nRachel: I\\'m all better now.\\n\\nPhoebe: (grins and walks to the kitchen and says to\\nChandler and Joey.) I helped!\\n\\nMonica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best,\\ny\\'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.\\xa0 The whole,\\n\\'hat\\' thing.\\n\\nJoey: (comforting her) And hey, you need anything,\\nyou can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he\\'s away a lot.\\n\\nMonica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It\\'s her wedding\\nday!\\n\\nJoey: What, like there\\'s a rule or something?\\n\\n(The door buzzer sounds and Chandler gets it.)\\n\\nChandler: Please don\\'t do that again, it\\'s a\\nhorrible sound.\\n\\nPaul: (over the intercom) It\\'s, uh,\\nit\\'s Paul.\\n\\nMonica: Oh God, is it\\n6:30?\\xa0 Buzz him in!\\n\\nJoey: Who\\'s Paul?\\n\\nRoss: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\\n\\nMonica: Maybe.

Your \\'not a real\\ndate\\' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\\n\\nRoss: He finally asked you out?\\n\\nMonica: Yes!\\n\\nChandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.\\n\\nMonica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...\\n\\nRachel: Please, no, go, that\\'d be fine!\\n\\nMonica: (to Ross) Are, are you okay? I mean, do you\\nwant me to stay?\\n\\nRoss: (choked voice) That\\'d be good...\\n\\nMonica: (horrified) Really?\\n\\nRoss: (normal voice) No, go on! It\\'s Paul the Wine\\nGuy!\\n\\nPhoebe: What does that mean? \\xa0\\nDoes he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot? (Chandler doesn\\'t know.)\\n\\n(There\\'s a knock on the door and it\\'s Paul.)\\n\\nMonica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. (They are all\\nlined up next to the door.)... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\\n\\nAll: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!\\n\\nChandler: I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t catch your name.

(Shows Paul in) Two seconds.\\n\\nPhoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That\\ncan\\'t be good.\\n\\n(Monica goes to change.)\\n\\nJoey:\\xa0 Hey, Paul!\\n\\nPaul: Yeah?\\n\\nJoey: Here\\'s a little tip, she\\nreally likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until\\nit starts to get a little red.\\n\\nMonica: (yelling from the bedroom)\\nShut up, Joey!\\n\\nRoss: So Rachel, what\\'re you, uh... what\\'re you up\\nto tonight?\\n\\nRachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for\\nAruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!\\n\\nRoss: Right, you\\'re not even getting your honeymoon,\\nGod.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- (thinks) -big\\nlizards... Anyway, if you don\\'t feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are\\ncoming over to help me put together my new furniture.\\n\\nChandler: (deadpan) Yes, and we\\'re very excited\\nabout it. \\n\\nRachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I\\'m just\\ngonna hang out here tonight.\\xa0 It\\'s been kinda a long day.\\n\\nRoss: Okay, sure.\\n\\nJoey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?\\n\\nPhoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don\\'t want to.\\n\\nCommercial Break\\n\\n[Scene: The Subway, Phoebe is singing for\\nchange.]\\n\\nPhoebe: (singing) Love is sweet as\\nsummer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is\\nlike a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart.\\xa0 La-la-la-la-la- (some guy gives her some\\nchange and to that guy) Thank you. (sings) La-la-la-la...ohhh!\\n\\n[Scene: Ross\\'s Apartment, the guys are there assembling\\nfurniture.]\\n\\nRoss: (squatting and reading the instructions) I\\'m\\nsupposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm\\nguys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.\\n\\n(Joey and Chandler are finishing assembling\\nthe bookcase.)\\n\\nJoey: I\\'m thinking we\\'ve got a\\nbookcase here.\\n\\nChandler: It\\'s a beautiful thing.\\n\\nJoey: (picking up a leftover part) What\\'s this?\\n\\nChandler: I would have to\\nsay that is an \\'L\\'-shaped bracket.\\n\\nJoey: Which goes where?\\n\\nChandler: I have no\\nidea.\\n\\n(Joey checks that Ross is not looking and dumps it in a\\nplant.)\\n\\nJoey: Done with the bookcase!\\n\\nChandler: All finished!\\n\\nRoss: (clutching a beer can and sniffing) This was\\nCarol\\'s favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.\\n\\nJoey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you\\'re\\ngonna start with that stuff we\\'re outta here.\\n\\nChandler: Yes, please don\\'t spoil\\nall this fun.\\n\\nJoey: Ross, let me ask you a question.

I guess I\\nshould have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I\\nmean, how clean can teeth get?\\n\\nMonica: My brother\\'s going through that right now,\\nhe\\'s such a mess. How did you get through it?\\n\\nPaul: Well, you might try accidentally breaking\\nsomething valuable of hers, say her-\\n\\nMonica: -leg?\\n\\nPaul: (laughing) That\\'s one way! Me, I- I went for\\nthe watch.\\n\\nMonica: You actually broke her watch?\\xa0 Wow!\\xa0 The worst thing I ever did was, I-I shredded by\\nboyfriend\\'s favorite bath towel.\\n\\nPaul: Ooh, steer clear of you.\\n\\nMonica: That\\'s right.\\n[Scene: Monica\\'s Apartment, Rachel is talking on the phone and pacing.]\\n\\nRachel: Barry, I\\'m sorry... I am so sorry... I know\\nyou probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love\\nwith your socks on, but it isn\\'t... it isn\\'t, it\\'s about me, and I ju- (She stops talking\\nand dials the phone.) Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway...look,\\nlook, I know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become Mrs. Barry Finkel,\\nbut it isn\\'t me, it\\'s not me.\\xa0 And not that I have any idea who me is right now, but\\nyou just have to give me a chance too... (The maching cuts her off again and she redials.)\\n\\n[Scene: Ross\\'s Apartment; Ross is pacing while Joey and\\nChandler are working on some more furniture.]\\n\\nRoss: I\\'m divorced!\\xa0 I\\'m only\\n26 and I\\'m divorced!\\n\\nJoey: Shut up!\\n\\nChandler: You must stop! (Chandler\\nhits what he is working on with a hammer and it collapses.)\\n\\nRoss: That only took me an hour.\\n\\nChandler: Look, Ross, you gotta\\nunderstand, between us we haven\\'t had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.\\n\\xa0 You, however have had the love of a woman for four years. \\xa0\\nFour years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and\\nthat is why we don\\'t do it!\\xa0 I don\\'t think that was my point!\\n\\nRoss: You know what the scariest part is? What if\\nthere\\'s only one woman for everybody, y\\'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that\\'s\\nit? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...\\n\\nJoey: What are you talking about? \\'One woman\\'?\\nThat\\'s like saying there\\'s only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something,\\nRoss. There\\'s lots of flavors out there. There\\'s Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing!\\nCherry Vanilla. You could get \\'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the\\nbest thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight?\\nWelcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!\\n\\nRoss: I honestly don\\'t know if I\\'m hungry or horny.\\n\\nChandler: Stay out of my freezer! [Scene: A\\nRestaurant, Monica and Paul are still eating.]\\n\\nPaul: Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh...\\n\\nMonica: What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with\\nnoodles?\\n\\nPaul: No, it\\'s, it\\'s more of a fifth date kinda\\nrevelation.\\n\\nMonica: Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?\\n\\nPaul: Isn\\'t there?\\n\\nMonica: Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were\\nyou gonna say?\\n\\nPaul: Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um,\\nI haven\\'t been able to, uh, perform. (Monica takes a sip of her drink.) ...Sexually. \\n\\nMonica: (spitting out her drink in shock) Oh God, oh\\nGod, I am sorry... I am so sorry...\\n\\nPaul: It\\'s okay...\\n\\nMonica: I know being spit on is probably not what\\nyou need right now. Um... how long?\\n\\nPaul: Two years.\\n\\nMonica: Wow! I\\'m-I\\'m-I\\'m glad you smashed her watch!\\n\\n\\nPaul: So you still think you, um... might want that\\nfifth date?\\n\\nMonica: (pause)...Yeah.

That\\'s\\nthe difference!\\n\\n[Scene: Ross\\'s Apartment, they\\'re all sitting around and\\ntalking.]\\n\\nRoss: (scornful) Grab a spoon. Do you know how long\\nit\\'s been since I\\'ve grabbed a spoon? Do the words \\'Billy, don\\'t be a hero\\' mean anything\\nto you? \\n\\nJoey: Great story!\\xa0 But, I uh,\\nI gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...\\xa0 Oh man, (looks to Chandler)\\n\\nChandler: Angela\\'s the screamer,\\nAndrea has cats.\\n\\nJoey: Right.\\xa0 Thanks.\\xa0\\nIt\\'s June.\\xa0 I\\'m outta here. (Exits.)\\n\\nRoss: Y\\'know, here\\'s the thing. Even if I could get\\nit together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?

I mean, I have never\\nmade coffee before in my entire life.\\n\\nChandler: That is amazing.\\n\\nJoey: Congratulations. \\n\\nRachel: Y\\'know, I figure if I can\\nmake coffee, there isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do.\\n\\nChandler: If can invade Poland,\\nthere isn\\'t anything I can\\'t do.\\n\\nJoey: Listen, while you\\'re on a roll, if you feel\\nlike you gotta make like a Western omelet or something...

That\\'s why I was getting married. \\n\\nPhoebe: Give her a break, it\\'s hard being on your own for the first time. \\n\\nRachel: Thank you. \\n\\nPhoebe: You\\'re welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was\\nfourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got\\nhere, and I didn\\'t know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like,\\ncleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found\\naromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel. \\n\\n(Pause) \\n\\nRoss: The word you\\'re looking for is \\'Anyway\\'... \\n\\nMonica: All right, you ready?\\n\\nRachel: No.\\xa0 No, no, I\\'m not\\nready!\\xa0 How can I be ready?\\xa0 \"Hey, Rach!\\xa0 You ready to jump out the\\nairplane without your parachute?\"\\xa0 Come on, I can\\'t do this!\\n\\nMonica: You can, I know you\\ncan! \\n\\nRachel: I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nRoss: Come on, you made\\ncoffee! \\xa0 You can do anything! (Chandler slowly tries to hide the now dead plant from\\nthat morning when he and Joey poured their coffee into it.)\\n\\nRoss: C\\'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,... \\n\\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... (She cuts one of them and they cheer.)\\n\\nRachel: Y\\'know what?\\xa0 I think\\nwe can just leave it at that.\\xa0 It\\'s kinda like a symbolic gesture...\\n\\nMonica:\\xa0 Rachel!\\xa0\\nThat was a library card! \\n\\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..\\n\\nChandler: (as Rachel is cutting up\\nher cards) Y\\'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream. \\n\\n(She finishes cutting them up and they all\\ncheer.)\\n\\nMonica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You\\'re\\ngonna love it! \\n\\n[Time Lapse, Rachel and Ross are watching a TV channel finishes it\\'s broadcast day by\\nplaying the national anthem.] \\n\\nMonica: Well, that\\'s it (To Ross) You gonna crash on the couch? \\n\\nRoss: No. No, I gotta go home sometime. \\n\\nMonica: You be okay? \\n\\nRoss: Yeah. \\n\\nRachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor. (Monica smiles.) What? \\n\\nMonica: That\\'s Paul\\'s watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy.\\nAlright. Goodnight, everybody. \\n\\nRoss and Rachel: Goodnight.\\n\\n(Monica stomps on Paul\\'s watch and goes into her room.)\\n\\nRoss: Mmm. (They both reach for the last cookie) Oh, no- \\n\\nRachel: Sorry- \\n\\nRoss: No no no, go- \\n\\nRachel: No, you have it, really, I don\\'t want it- \\n\\nRoss: Split it? \\n\\nRachel: Okay. \\n\\nRoss: Okay. (They split it.) You know you probably didn\\'t know this, but back in\\nhigh school, I had a, um, major crush on you. \\n\\nRachel: I knew. \\n\\nRoss: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica\\'s geeky\\nolder brother. \\n\\nRachel: I did. \\n\\nRoss: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability\\nbecome any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out?\\nSometime? Maybe? \\n\\nRachel: Yeah, maybe... \\n\\nRoss: Okay... okay, maybe I will... \\n\\nRachel: Goodnight. \\n\\nRoss: Goodnight. \\n\\n(Rachel goes into her room and Monica enters the living room as Ross is leaving.) \\n\\nMonica: See ya.... Waitwait, what\\'s with you? \\n\\nRoss: I just grabbed a spoon. (Ross exits and Monica has no idea what that\\nmeans.) \\n\\nClosing Credits\\n\\n[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there.] \\n\\nJoey: I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing here. \\n\\nPhoebe: (sings) I can\\'t believe what I\\'m hearing here... \\n\\nMonica: What? I-I said you had a- \\n\\nPhoebe: (sings) What I said you had... \\n\\nMonica: (to Phoebe) Would you stop? \\n\\nPhoebe: Oh, was I doing it again?\\n\\nAll: Yes!\\n\\nMonica: I said that you had a nice\\nbutt, it\\'s just not a great butt.\\n\\nJoey: Oh, you wouldn\\'t know a great\\nbutt if it came up and bit ya.\\n\\nRoss: There\\'s an image.\\n\\n\\nRachel: (walks up with a pot of coffee) Would anybody like more coffee? \\n\\nChandler: Did you make it, or are you just serving it? \\n\\nRachel: I\\'m just serving it. \\n\\nAll: Yeah. Yeah, I\\'ll have a cup of coffee. \\n\\nChandler: Kids, new dream... I\\'m in Las Vegas. (Rachel\\nsits down to hear Chandler\\'s dream.)\\n\\nCustomer: (To\\nRachel) Ahh, miss? \\xa0 More coffee? \\n\\nRachel: Ugh. (To another customer that\\'s leaving.) Excuse me, could you give\\nthis to that guy over there? (Hands him the coffee pot.) Go ahead. (He does so.) Thank\\nyou. (To the gang.) Sorry.\\xa0 Okay, Las Vegas.\\n\\nChandler: Okay, so, I\\'m in Las\\nVegas... I\\'m Liza Minelli- \\n\\nEnd\\n\\n\\n'"

It\\'s a scene from 1016 TOW\\nRachel\\'s Going Away Party.]\\nJennifer Aniston (V.O.): Previously on Friends.\\nMonica: Erica, are you okay?\\nErica: Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much. I keep getting these \\n  stomach-aches. They come and go like every few minutes.\\nMonica: Oh my God!\\nChandler: Relax! We\\'ll just get her some antacids.\\nMonica: She doesn\\'t have a stomach-ache. She\\'s in labor!\\nChandler: Oh my God!\\n\\xa0\\n[Cut to Ross\\'s apartment. Ross and Rachel are there. It\\'s another \\n  scene from 1016 TOW Rachel\\'s Going Away Party.]\\nRachel: So if you think I didn\\'t say goodbye to you because you don\\'t \\n  mean as much to me as everybody else, you\\'re wrong. It\\'s because you \\n  mean more to me.\\nRoss: Rach!\\nRachel: What?!\\n(He walks over and kisses her. They pull back, Rachel looks at him, \\nand they kiss again.)\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: Ross\\'s bedroom. Rachel is putting on her shoes as Ross shows \\n  up from underneath the covers.]\\nRoss: Hey.\\nRachel: Shh.. Go back to sleep. I have to go home.\\nRoss: Oh. This was amazing.\\nRachel: It really was. You\\'ve learned some new moves!\\nRoss: Yeah, well, this guy at work gave me \"Sex for Dummies\" as a \\n  joke.\\nRachel: Ah.\\nRoss: Who\\'s laughing now?\\nRachel: I know!\\n(They kiss.)\\n\\xa0\\nOPENING CREDITS\\n[Scene: The delivery room at the hospital. Monica, Chandler and Erica \\n  are there. Erica is in labor, and she is breathing heavily.]\\nMonica: Breathe, breathe, breathe... Good.\\nChandler: Next time, can I say breathe?\\nMonica: No, last time you said it like Dracula, and it scared her! Can \\n  I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?\\nErica: No, I\\'m okay.\\nMonica: Alright, I\\'ll be right back.\\nChandler: Where are you going?\\nMonica: To use the bathroom.\\nChandler: You can\\'t leave me alone with her.\\nMonica: What?\\nChandler: This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not \\n  comfortable with!\\nMonica: What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?\\nChandler: It\\'s just that we\\'ve never spent any time, you know, alone \\n  together.\\nMonica: You\\'ll be fine. Nah, you won\\'t, but I\\'ll be back in two \\n  minutes.\\nChandler: Okay.\\n(Monica leaves, and Chandler closes the door. Erica just looks at \\n  him.)\\nChandler: So, ah... Any plans for the summer?\\nErica: I don\\'t know. Maybe church-camp?\\nChandler: Hah. May not wanna mention this. So, you ever wonder which \\n  is worse, you know; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?\\nErica: What?\\nChandler: Well, it\\'s just interesting. You know, because no one will \\n  ever know, because no one can experience both.\\n(Erica just looks at him like he\\'s crazy.)\\nChandler: One of life\\'s great, unanswerable questions. I mean, who \\n  knows? Maybe there\\'s something even more painful than those things? \\nLike this.\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: Joey and Rachel\\'s apartment. Joey is there as Phoebe enters. \\n  Joey is holding a baby duck.]\\nPhoebe: Morning.\\nJoey: Hey!\\nPhoebe: What\\'s that?\\nJoey: It\\'s my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.\\nPhoebe: It\\'s a baby chick and duck!\\nJoey: Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.\\nPhoebe: I did not see that coming.\\nJoey: Yeah, I figure they\\'ll love it at the new house, you know? It \\n  has that big backyard. And then, when they get old, they can go to \\n  that special farm that Chandler took the other chick and duck to.\\nPhoebe: Yes.\\nJoey: Yeah. It\\'s a shame people can\\'t visit there.\\nPhoebe: That is the rule, though.\\n(Ross enters.)\\nPhoebe: Guess what? You\\'re almost an uncle!\\nRoss: What?\\nJoey: Yeah, Erica went into labor last night. Monica and Chandler are \\n  at the hospital right now!\\nRoss: Oh my God!\\nPhoebe: Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it\\'s gonna be a girl.\\nRoss: Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.\\nPhoebe: Have you seen him throw a ball?\\nRoss: Is Rachel here?\\nJoey: Uh, I think she\\'s still asleep. Hey, hey, how did it go with you \\n  guys last night? She seemed pretty pissed at you.\\nRoss: Uh, we, y\\'know, we worked things out.\\nPhoebe: What\\'s that smile? Did something happen with you two?\\nRoss: Hey, I\\'m not one to kiss and tell, but I\\'m also not one to have \\n  sex and shut up. We totally did it!\\nJoey: Oh my God. You and Rachel?\\nRoss: I know, it\\'s pretty great.\\nJoey: So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?\\nRoss: Oh, I.. I don\\'t know. We didn\\'t really get to talk.\\nPhoebe: But do you wanna get back together?\\nRoss: I don\\'t know. It was incredible. I mean, it just felt so right. \\n  When I was holding her, I mean, I never wanted to let her go. You know \\n  what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.\\nPhoebe: (screaming) YAY!\\nRoss: Shhh!\\nPhoebe: (quietly) Yay!\\nJoey: So, so is she still going to Paris?\\nRoss: Wow, I hadn\\'t thought of that. I hope not.\\nPhoebe: Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever! You guys might get \\n  back together, Monica and Chandler are getting their baby, there are \\n  chicks and ducks in the world again! Oh, I feel like I\\'m in a musical! \\n  (Singing) \"Daa - raa... When the sun comes up, bright and beaming! And \\n  the moon comes...\"\\n(Rachel enters from her room.)\\nRachel: Morning!\\nPhoebe: Guess we\\'ll never know how it ends.\\nJoey: Okay.\\nRoss: Hey.\\nRachel: Hey.\\nRoss: Hey. How did you sleep?\\nRachel: Good. You?\\nRoss: Good.\\nJoey: I bet you did!\\nRoss: Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?\\nJoey: Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?\\nRachel: Chick and the duck? Didn\\'t they die...\\nPhoebe: (interrupting) Dive. Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on \\n  the farm.\\n(Joey and Phoebe leave.)\\nRoss: So...\\n(He kisses her.)\\nRoss: Morning.\\nRachel: You too. Last night was just wonderful.\\nRoss: It really was.\\nRachel: I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.\\nRoss: I know, me too. It was... You know, it was like one of those \\n  things you think is never gonna happen, and then it does, and it\\'s \\n  everything you want it to be.\\nRachel: Uh-huh. I know. It was just, it was just the perfect way to say goodbye. (She hugs him, and Ross looks crushed.)\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: The Hospital. Erica is moaning and about to give birth. \\n  Monica, Chandler, a nurse and a doctor are there with her.]\\nMonica: It\\'s just a little bit more, honey.\\nErica: Help me! This hurts!\\nChandler: Is it really that bad?\\nErica: Uh-huh! I think it\\'s time to kick you in the nuts and see which \\n  is worse!\\n(Monica gives Chandler a look.)\\nDoctor: The baby\\'s head is crowning.\\n(Monica walks down to Erica\\'s legs to watch the birth.)\\nMonica: Oh! Oh my God! That is the most beautiful top of a head I have \\n  ever seen! Chandler, you have to see this!\\n(Chandler is standing by Erica\\'s head.)\\nChandler: I\\'m okay.\\nMonica: Chandler, you don\\'t wanna miss this. This is the birth of your \\n  child! It\\'s the miracle of life!\\nChandler: Alright. Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.\\nDoctor: Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...\\n(The baby starts crying, and the doctor holds it up.)\\nMonica: It\\'s a... It\\'s a boy!\\nChandler: Wow!\\nErica: Is he okay?\\nDoctor: He\\'s just fine.\\nMonica: Oh, you did it!\\nChandler: (emotional) It\\'s a baby! A beautiful little baby! And some\\n  other stuff I\\'m gonna pretend I don\\'t see.\\nDoctor: Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?\\n(A nurse gives Monica a pair of scissors. Monica gives it to Chandler, \\n  and they cut it together.)\\nChandler: Well, that\\'s spongy.\\nMonica: (to her son) Oh, hey handsome! Oh, I\\'m gonna love you so much\\n  that no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you! (To Chandler, on\\n  the verge of tears) Oh, we are so lucky!\\nChandler: I know. He has your eyes.\\n(Monica looks at him.)\\nChandler: I mean, I know that\\'s not possible, but he does.\\nNurse: We\\'ll just get him cleaned up a bit.\\n(The doctor hands the boy to the nurse, and she walks over to another \\n  part of the room with him.)\\nChandler: Okay.\\nMonica: (To Erica) Oh my God, he\\'s beautiful. Thank you so much.\\nErica: I\\'m really happy for you guys.\\nChandler: How do you feel?\\nErica: I\\'m tired!\\nDoctor: Well, you don\\'t have that much time to relax. The other one \\n  will be along in a minute.\\n(Chandler stares at the doctor, completely shocked. Monica just \\n  freezes and turns around slowly.)\\nMonica: I... I\\'m sorry, who should be along in a what now?\\nDoctor: The next baby should be along in a minute.\\nMonica: We only ordered one!\\nDoctor: You know it\\'s twins, right?\\nChandler: Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!\\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK\\n[Scene: The hospital. Continued from earlier.]\\nDoctor: I can\\'t believe you didn\\'t know it\\'s twins! This has never \\n  happened before.\\nChandler: Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.\\nMonica: (to the doctor) Wait, did you know it was twins?\\nDoctor: Yeah, it\\'s here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in \\n  Ohio.\\nMonica: (to Erica) Anybody tell you?\\nErica: I don\\'t think so. Although, they did mention something about \\n  two heartbeats. But I thought that was just mine and the baby\\'s. They \\n  kept saying both heartbeats are really strong, and I thought well, \\n  that\\'s good \\'cause I\\'m having a baby.\\nMonica: This is unbelievable.\\nErica: Twins actually run in my family.\\nChandler: Interesting! (To Monica) Can I see you for a second?\\n(They walk over to the door.)\\nChandler: What do we do?\\nMonica: What do you mean \"what do we do\"?\\nChandler: (panicking) Twins! Twins!!\\nMonica: Chandler, you\\'re panicking!\\nChandler: Uh-huh! Join me, won\\'t you?! Okay, what do you say we keep\\n  one, and then just like have an option on the other one?\\nMonica: We can\\'t split them up!\\nChandler: Why not? We could give each of them half a medallion, and \\n  then years later, they\\'ll find each other and be reunited. I mean, \\n  that\\'s a great day for everybody.\\nMonica: Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?\\nChandler: What if they\\'re not? What if it\\'s adopted by a king?\\nMonica: Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.\\nChandler: Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!\\nMonica: That doesn\\'t matter! We have waited so long for this. I don\\'t \\n  care if it\\'s two babies. I don\\'t care if it\\'s three babies! I don\\'t \\n  care if the entire cast of \"Eight is Enough\" comes out of there! We \\n  are taking them home, because they are our children!\\nChandler: (smiles) Okay. Shhh...\\n(He hugs her.)\\nChandler: Okay.\\nMonica: Okay!\\nChandler: Okay!\\nDoctor: It looks like we\\'re about ready over here.\\n(Monica and Chandler run back to Erica\\'s bed.)\\nDoctor: Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.\\nErica: Ow!\\n(Erica screams.)\\nDoctor: Here she comes!\\nChandler: (shocked) She? It\\'s a girl?\\nDoctor: Yeah.\\nChandler: (To Monica) Well, now we have one of each! (To the doctor) \\n  And that\\'s enough!\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: Central Perk. Ross, Phoebe and Joey are there.]\\nRoss: And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.\\nJoey: Oh my God! What did you say?\\nRoss: Nothing! What do you say to that?\\nPhoebe: Ross, you\\'ve got to tell her how you feel!\\nRoss: No way!\\nJoey: You can\\'t just give up! Is that what a dinosaur would do?\\nRoss: What?\\nJoey: Dude, I\\'m just trying to speak your language.\\nPhoebe: Ross, Rachel doesn\\'t know that you wanna get back together. If \\n  she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.\\nRoss: You really think so?\\nPhoebe: I\\'m telling you! Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical \\n  where there\\'d be a really good convincing song. (Singing) \"Bam-bam, \\n  don\\'t take no for an answer. Bam-bam, don\\'t let love fly away. \\n  Bam-bam-bam-bam...\"\\n(Rachel enters and interrupts Phoebe\\'s song.)\\nRachel: Hi!\\nPhoebe: Can\\'t a girl finish a song around here?\\nJoey: Hey!\\nRachel: Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom\\'s.\\nRoss: Okay.\\nJoey: Oh, you\\'re not taking her with you tonight?\\nRachel: No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, and \\n  then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.\\nPhoebe: Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.\\nRachel: Are you kidding? Eight hours with my mother talking about \\n  Atkins? Good luck, Emma!\\n(Rachel walks up to the counter.)\\nRoss: Alright, you know what? You\\'re right. I should at least tell her\\n  how I feel.\\n(He stands up.)\\nJoey: Ross, wait!\\nRoss: What? What?\\nJoey: Could you get me a muffin?\\n(Ross walks up to Rachel, but Gunther gets there first.)\\nGunther: Rachel?\\nRachel: Yeah?\\nGunther: I... I know you\\'re leaving tonight, but I just have to tell\\n  you. I love you.\\n(Ross is shocked.)\\nGunther: I... I don\\'t know if that changes your plans at all, but I\\n  thought you should know.\\nRachel: (touched) Gunther... Oh... I love you too. Probably not in the\\n  same way, but I do. And, and when I\\'m in a café, having coffee, or I\\n  see a man with hair brighter than the sun, I\\'ll think of you. Aw.\\n(She kisses him on the cheek and looks over at the others.)\\nRachel: Oh... Bye guys.\\n(Rachel leaves.)\\nRoss: Oh my God!\\nPhoebe: Unbelievable!\\nJoey: Hey, you know what might help?\\nRoss: I\\'m not getting you a muffin!\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: The hospital. Monica and Chandler are holding the twins, while\\n  two nurses are taking care of Erica.]\\nMonica: Do you think they recognize each other from in there?\\nChandler: Maybe. Unless they\\'re like two people who have lived in \\n  apartments next to each other for years, and then one day they\\'re \\n  pushed through a vagina and they meet.\\nNurse: We\\'re going to take Erica to recovery now.\\nMonica: There\\'s something that we wanna tell you. We decided to name \\n  the girl-baby Erica.\\nErica: Oh my God, that\\'s just like my name!\\nMonica: Son of a gun, it is!\\nErica: Anyway, I\\'m gonna go and get some rest. I\\'m really glad I \\n  picked you guys. You\\'re gonna make great parents. Even Chandler.\\nMonica: Okay, well, bye!\\nErica: Bye!\\nChandler: Bye!\\nMonica: We\\'ll call you!\\nErica: Okay.\\nChandler: Have fun at church-camp!\\n(The nurses take Erica to the recovery room. Monica and Chandler smile\\n  at each other.)\\nMonica: Oh, look at these little bunnies!\\nChandler: I know! You ready to trade?\\nMonica: Okay.\\nChandler: Okay.\\nMonica: Alright, let\\'s see..\\n(They start trying to trade babies while holding one each. They have \\n  no idea how to do it, so they just shift the babies around in their \\n  arms. They give up pretty quickly.)\\nChandler: We could trade later.\\nMonica: Yeah, I\\'m good.\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler\\'s apartment. Joey and Phoebe are there. \\n  There is a white crib decorated with balloons in the middle of the \\n  apartment. Also, there are boxes all over the apartment. Joey is \\n  working on something on the coffee table.]\\nPhoebe: Hey, what are you working on?\\nJoey: It\\'s a... It\\'s a \"welcome home\" sign for the baby.\\n(He holds up a white poster with huge red letters. It reads, \"Welcome\\n  Home Baby.\" There is also a huge red stain on the left of the poster.)\\nPhoebe: How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?\\n(She points at the stain.)\\nJoey: No, I sat in the paint.\\n(Ross enters with a gift for the baby.)\\nRoss: Hey.\\nPhoebe: Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?\\nRoss: No, and I\\'m not going to.\\nPhoebe: What?\\nJoey: Why not?\\nRoss: Because she\\'s just going to shoot me down. You guys saw what \\n  happened with Gunther. That did not look like fun.\\nPhoebe: How can you compare yourself to Gunther? I mean, sure, he\\'s \\n  sexy in a more obvious way. You have a relationship with her, you \\n  slept together last night.\\nRoss: Yeah, and she still wants to go! It\\'s pretty clear where she is.\\nJoey: Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...\\n(He sits down in the wet paint again.)\\nPhoebe: Uh, Joe?\\nJoey: Damn it!\\nRoss: Look, even if I were gonna tell her, I don\\'t have to do it now. \\n  Okay? I\\'ll be seeing her again. We\\'ve got time.\\nPhoebe: No, you don\\'t! She\\'s going to Paris! She is going to meet \\n  somebody. Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris? It\\'s... \\n  It\\'s a city of Gunthers!\\n(Mike enters with a roll of paper in his hand.)\\nMike: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Hey! What do you have there?\\nMike: Oh, I made a little something. If I had more time to work on it, \\n  it\\'d be better, but..\\n(He shows them a beautiful banner he has made. It reads, \"Welcome to \\n  the World, Baby Bing.\")\\nRoss: Oh my God! You did that yourself?\\nPhoebe: Honey, that\\'s gorgeous!\\nJoey: You know, the baby can\\'t read, Mike!\\n(Rachel enters.)\\nRachel: Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. I can\\'t believe\\n  they\\'re not home yet! I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the\\n  baby!\\nJoey: Monica just called from the cab. She said they should be here\\n  any minute. And apparently, there\\'s some big surprise.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, did she sound happy about it? \\'Cause my friend Ethel\\'s\\n  baby was born with a teeny, tiny beard.\\n(Monica enters carrying her son.)\\nRachel: Oh my God!\\nRoss: Oh my God!\\n(They all walk over to see the baby.)\\nRachel: Hi! Oh my gosh!\\n(Chandler enters carrying his daughter.)\\nChandler: Hey.\\n(Everybody turns around.)\\nPhoebe, Ross, Rachel: Hey.\\n(They turn back around to see the baby Monica\\'s carrying, but then \\n  they realise what the surprise is. Ross, Mike, Phoebe and Rachel gasp \\n  and stare at Chandler and his baby. Joey hasn\\'t figured it out yet.)\\nJoey: (To Monica) Hey, so what is the big surprise?\\nRachel: Oh.\\n(Joey stares at Chandler and Monica and finally puts two and two \\n  together. He gasps.)\\nRoss: Oh my God!\\nRachel: What... What...\\nRoss: Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, \\n  right?\\nMonica: Yes, it\\'s twins!\\nRoss: Oh my God.\\nJoey: Oh, they\\'re so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?\\nMonica: (points at the baby she\\'s holding) This is a boy, (points at \\n  the baby Chandler is holding) and that\\'s a girl.\\nChandler: Her name is Erica.\\nRachel: Aw..\\nJoey: Hey, that pregnant girl\\'s name was Erica.\\nChandler: Yeah. It\\'s a shame you two didn\\'t get to spend more time\\n  together.\\nMonica: Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.\\nRoss: Aw, he\\'s gonna be so happy.\\nPhoebe: Oh, Jack Bing. I love that. Ooh, it sounds like a \\'40s\\n  newspaper guy, you know? \"Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. I\\'m gonna blow\\n  this story wide open!\"\\n(Chandler and Monica carry Erica and Jack over to the crib and put\\n  them down carefully.)\\nRachel: Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.\\nMike: (To Phoebe) I want one.\\nPhoebe: Oh yeah? Well, tell me which one, and I\\'ll try slip it in my\\n  coat.\\nMike: Seriously. Wanna make one of those?\\nPhoebe: One? How about a whole bunch?\\nMike: Really?\\nPhoebe: Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, and we can be like the\\n  Von Trapp family! Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda\\n  dull.\\nRachel: Oh, you guys, I can\\'t believe this. But I\\'ll leave now, or I\\'m\\n  gonna miss my plane.\\nMonica: I\\'m just so glad you got to see the babies.\\n(They hug.)\\nRachel: Me too. Oh, I\\'m just sorry I\\'m not gonna be around to watch\\n  you two attempt to handle this! Alright, I can\\'t say goodbye to you\\n  guys again. I love you all so much.\\nMonica: I love you.\\nChandler: I love you.\\nMonica: Call us when you get there.\\nRachel: I will. Ross, come here.\\n(She pulls him over to the door.)\\nRachel: I just want you to know.. Last night.. I\\'ll never forget it.\\nRoss: Neither will I.\\n(They hug as Phoebe and Joey stare at the two of them.)\\nRachel: Alright, now I really have to go. Okay. Au revoir! Oh, they\\'re \\n  gonna really hate me over there.\\n(She leaves.)\\nPhoebe: So, you just let her go?\\nRoss: Yeah.\\nJoey: Hey, maybe that\\'s for the best.\\nRoss: Yeah?\\nJoey: Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... You gotta think \\n  about last night the way she does, okay? Maybe, maybe sleeping \\n  together was the perfect way to say goodbye?\\nPhoebe: But now she\\'ll never know how he feels!\\nJoey: Maybe that\\'s okay. You know? Maybe, maybe it is better this way? \\n  I mean, now, now you can move on. I mean, you\\'ve been trying to for so\\n  long, maybe now that you\\'re on different continents.. (Looks at\\n  Phoebe) Right?\\n(Phoebe nods.)\\nJoey: Maybe now you can actually do it. You know? You can finally get\\n  over her.\\nRoss: Yeah, that\\'s true. Except I don\\'t wanna get over her.\\nJoey: What?\\nRoss: I don\\'t! I wanna be with her.\\nJoey: Really?\\nRoss: Yeah, I\\'m gonna go after her.\\nJoey: Yeah, you are!\\nPhoebe: Woo!\\n(Monica and Chandler look shocked as Ross goes to leave.)\\nPhoebe: Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!\\nRoss: My coat...\\nJoey: This is so cool!\\nChandler: I have no idea what\\'s going on, but I am excited!\\nJoey: But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she\\'s going to\\n  say?\\nRoss: I don\\'t know, but I.. Look, even if she shoots me down, at least\\n  I won\\'t spend the rest of my life wondering what would have happened.\\n  Where - where is my coat?!\\nPhoebe: You didn\\'t bring one! My cab\\'s downstairs, I\\'ll drive you to\\n  the airport.\\nRoss: Okay, guys, wish me luck.\\nPhoebe: Hurry!\\nJoey: Good luck, good luck!\\n(Phoebe and Ross leave.)\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: The street right in front of Central Perk. Phoebe\\'s cab is\\n  there. Ross and Phoebe run over and jump in.]\\nRoss: There\\'s no seatbelt!\\nPhoebe: That\\'s okay. If - if we hit anything, the engine will explode, \\n  so you know, it\\'s better if you\\'re thrown from the car.\\n(Ross looks terrified.)\\nRoss: Alright, alright, let\\'s do this!\\nPhoebe: Okay!\\n(A guy comes up and gets into the backseat of the cab.)\\nRoss: Hey!\\nMan: 18th and East End.\\nPhoebe: I - I don\\'t take passengers.\\nMan: Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.\\nRoss: No, you don\\'t understand. This isn\\'t a real cab.\\nMan: Alright, I gotta report you. What\\'s your medallion number?\\nPhoebe: My medallion number is, \"Get out of the cab!\"\\nMan: What?\\nRoss: (screaming) Get out of the cab!\\nPhoebe: Get out of the cab!\\n(The man jumps out, obviously a little scared. Phoebe drives off.)\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler\\'s apartment. Monica, Chandler and Joey are\\n  there, packing the last boxes.]\\nJoey: Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present \\n  now?\\nMonica: Now, that you can do.\\nJoey: Alright!\\n(Cut to Joey\\'s apartment. Joey looks inside the cardboard box that\\n  used to be the home of Chick Jr. and Duck Jr., but they have\\n  disappeared.)\\nJoey: Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.? Don\\'t hide from mama!\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: Phoebe\\'s cab. Phoebe is driving very fast, and a terrified\\n  Ross has closed his eyes.]\\nPhoebe: You can open your eyes now.\\nRoss: Are we off the bridge?\\nPhoebe: Yes.\\nRoss: Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?\\nPhoebe: Yes, she jumped right back up.\\n(Ross opens his eyes.)\\nRoss: Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!\\nPhoebe: Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?\\nRoss: Yes, but I don\\'t wanna die in your cab!\\nPhoebe: You should have thought of that before you got in!\\n(They drive up to a toll-booth.)\\nPhoebe: Toll-booth.\\nRoss: What?\\nPhoebe: (screaming) Toll-booth! Four bucks. There are quarters in the \\n  glove compartment.\\n(Ross tries to open a plastic bag filled with quarters, but he\\'s quite\\n  slow.)\\nPhoebe: Hurry!\\nRoss: Okay!\\nPhoebe: Okay.\\n(Phoebe tries to throw some quarters out the window, but she has\\n  forgotten to open the window, and she and Ross scream.)\\nPhoebe: Damn, that window is clean.\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: Joey\\'s apartment. Joey is still looking for the birds.]\\nJoey: Quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack,\\n  quack, tweet, tweet, quack, quack, tweet, tweet, quack, tweet, quack...\\n(Monica and Chandler enter.)\\nChandler: We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but\\n  now we understand you were doing this.\\nJoey: Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but for your house-warming gift,\\n  I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!\\n(Chandler grins, while Monica is less enthusiastic.)\\nChandler: Really? You got us a chick and a duck?\\nMonica: Oh, great! Just what you want for a new house with infants.\\n  Bird feces.\\nJoey: Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, \\'cause now\\n  they\\'re gone!\\nChandler: Oh, don\\'t worry, we\\'ll find them.\\nMonica: Actually, I\\'m gonna go check on the twins.\\nChandler: Alright.\\n(Monica turns around and is about to leave when she steps on\\n  something.)\\nMonica: Oh God! What did I just step on?\\nJoey: Oh!\\nChandler: It\\'s okay, it\\'s just an egg roll.\\nMonica: Oh..\\nJoey: You stepped on my egg roll?\\nMonica: I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t know to look for Chinese food on the \\n  floor.\\nJoey: Just put it on a plate and leave.\\n(She does so.)\\nChandler: Okay, let\\'s find these birds.\\nJoey: Alright.\\n(Suddenly, they hear the birds.)\\nJoey: Wait, wait. Do you hear that?\\n(They realise that the birds are in the foosball table.)\\nJoey: Oh! They\\'re in the table!\\nChandler: Well, that can\\'t be good!\\nJoey: We gotta get them out of there!\\nChandler: How?\\nJoey: Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure them out. You know any birdcalls?\\nChandler: Oh, tons, I\\'m quite the woodsman.\\nJoey: Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.\\nChandler: Joey, wait! The ball!\\nJoey: Oh!\\n(The ball rolls into one of the goals, and Chandler and Joey listen in \\n  horror as the ball makes its way inside the table. Finally, they can \\n  hear the birds again.)\\nJoey: Oh God! So what do we do?\\nChandler: I don\\'t know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.\\nJoey: Okay.\\nChandler: No... It\\'s all glued together.\\nJoey: Does that mean we have to bust it open?\\nChandler: I don\\'t know. Maybe.\\nJoey: Oh my God!\\nChandler: I know! It\\'s.. It\\'s the foosball table.\\nJoey: All right, you know what? We don\\'t have a choice. It\\'s like I would \\n  have said in that sci-fi movie if I\\'d gotten the part. \"Those are our \\n  men in there, we have to get them out! Even if I have to sacrifice the \\n  most important thing in my life; my time-machine.\"\\nChandler: Did that movie ever get made?\\nJoey: It did not.\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: The airport. Ross and Phoebe run in.]\\nPhoebe: Ross, where are you going?\\nRoss: To talk to Rachel, isn\\'t that why we took a ride in the \\n  death-cab?\\nPhoebe: What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate? Have \\n  you never chased anyone through the airport before?\\nRoss: Not since my cop-show got cancelled.\\nPhoebe: You have to get a ticket to get past security.\\nRoss: What? We\\'re never gonna make it!\\nPhoebe: Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!\\n(They run to the ticket counter, but they get stuck behind a group of \\n  old people who are walking very slowly.)\\nRoss: Okay, if you could all walk slower, that\\'d be great. \\n\\xa0 \\n[Scene: The gate. Rachel walks up to the man at the gate and gives him \\nher passport.]\\nGate attendant #1: (with a French accent) Madame, your passport \\n  please?\\nRachel: Oh my God! I was so afraid I wasn\\'t gonna remember any of my \\n  high-school French, but I understood every word you just said!\\nGate attendant #1: Your boarding pass, please.\\nRachel: Oh.\\n(She starts looking through her purse, but she can\\'t find it.)\\nRachel: Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, I can\\'t believe this.\\nGate attendant #1: Madame, if you don\\'t have your boarding pass...\\nRachel: I have it, I have it, I have it. Oh, okay, I can\\'t find it, \\n  but I remember that I was in seat 32C, because that\\'s my bra-size.\\nGate attendant #1: Madame, you must have your boarding pass..\\nRachel: Okay, fine! But you know what? If I was in 36D, we would not \\nbe having this problem. \\n\\xa0 \\n[Scene: The ticket-counter. Ross and Phoebe come running.]\\nRoss: Hey, I need a ticket.\\nPhoebe: Just one? I drive you all the way down here, and I don\\'t get \\n  to see how it works out?\\nRoss: Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.\\nPhoebe: We\\'re on our honeymoon.\\nTicket agent: And the destination?\\nRoss: I don\\'t care. Whatever is the cheapest.\\nPhoebe: I\\'m so lucky I married you.\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: The gate. Rachel is still searching for her boarding pass.]\\nRachel: Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? Oh! Oh! I found it! I found \\n  it!\\n(She runs up to the gate and the gate attendant standing there.)\\nRachel: Hah! I found it! I told you I would find it! In your face! \\nYou\\'re a different person. \\n\\xa0 \\n[Scene: The ticket-counter. Ross and Phoebe have their tickets and \\n  start looking at the screens in order to find the gate.]\\nRoss: Okay, flight 421 to Paris. I don\\'t see it, do you see it?\\nPhoebe: No, did we miss it?\\nRoss: No, no, no. That\\'s impossible. It doesn\\'t leave for another 20 \\n  minutes.\\nPhoebe: Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.\\n(Phoebe picks up her cell-phone and calls Monica. Monica is still packing in her apartment.)\\nMonica: Hello.\\nPhoebe: Hey, it\\'s me. Here\\'s Ross.\\nRoss: What? Hey, hey, listen..\\n(Monica is standing by the crib, and she\\'s looking at her babies.)\\nMonica: Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn\\'t believe the cute little noises \\n  the twins are making. Listen.\\n(She holds the phone down to the twins.)\\nRoss: Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?\\nMonica: Oh, I\\'m sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.\\nRoss: That\\'s alright. Listen, listen.\\nMonica: Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.\\n(She holds down the phone to the twins again.)\\nRoss: Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?\\nMonica: Isn\\'t that cute?\\nRoss: That is precious! Listen! I need Rachel\\'s flight information.\\nMonica: Oh, okay. Alright, it\\'s flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.\\nRoss: Yes, that\\'s what I have. It\\'s not on the board.\\nMonica: That\\'s what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40, Newark \\n  airport.\\nRoss: What?\\nMonica: Newark airport. Why, where are you?\\nRoss: JFK.\\n(Ross sadly hangs up the phone, while Phoebe looks at him. Cut to Rachel at the gate. She gives her boarding pass to the gate \\n  attendant, and she goes onboard. The gate attendant closes the door \\nand locks it.) \\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: Joey\\'s apartment. Joey and Chandler are still trying to get \\n  the birds out of the foosball-table.]\\nJoey: (yelling) Don\\'t worry, you guys, we\\'re gonna get you out of \\n  there.\\nChandler: And we\\'re also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.\\n(Joey picks up a hammer and a crowbar and gets ready to destroy the \\n  table.)\\nJoey: Okay. Here goes.\\nChandler: What\\'s the matter?\\nJoey: I need to say goodbye to the table first.\\nChandler: I understand.\\nJoey: Okay. Table, you have given us so many great times. And you \\n  guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. What can I say? You \\n  guys make us look good. You wanna say anything?\\nChandler: I don\\'t know. Except that, for one last time... (he touches \\n  the players as he says the following) Good game, good game, good game, \\n  good game, good game, good game, good game.\\nJoey: Okay, here we go. I can\\'t do it.\\nChandler: Well, I can\\'t do it either.\\n(Monica enters.)\\nMonica: Hey! Did you find them?\\nJoey: Yeah, they\\'re stuck inside the table!\\nChandler: We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!\\nMonica: Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard. I\\'ll do it. Gimme!\\n(Monica grabs the hammer and the crowbar and gets ready to bust it \\nopen.) \\n\\xa0 \\n[Scene: Phoebe\\'s cab. She\\'s driving faster than ever before.]\\nRoss: Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!\\n(Phoebe screams.)\\nPhoebe: Well, I\\'ve never gone this fast before.\\nRoss: Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away. \\n  There\\'s no way we\\'re gonna make it in time.\\nPhoebe: She\\'s got her cell, you could call her.\\nRoss: I am not doing this over the phone.\\nPhoebe: You don\\'t have any other choice!\\n(She lets go of the steering wheel to get her cell-phone from her \\n  purse. Ross screams and reaches over in order to hold onto the wheel. Cut to the plane. Rachel is sitting in her seat when her cell-phone \\n  rings.)\\nRachel: Hello?\\nPhoebe: Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the \\n  plane?\\nRachel: Yeah.\\nPhoebe: (To Ross) For what it\\'s worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.\\nRoss: Yay.\\nPhoebe: Uh, Rach, hang on.\\n(Phoebe tries to give her phone to Ross, but he won\\'t take it. He \\n  mouths \"no.\")\\nRachel: Phoebe? Is everything okay?\\nPhoebe: Uhm, actually no. No, you\\'ve... You have to get off the plane.\\nRachel: What? Why?\\nPhoebe: I have this feeling that something\\'s wrong with it. Something \\n  is wrong with the left Philange.\\nRachel: Oh, honey, I\\'m sure there\\'s nothing wrong with the plane.\\n(The passenger in the seat next to Rachel looks at her and seems a \\n  little nervous.)\\nRachel: Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you \\n  the minute I get to Paris.\\n(Rachel hangs up.)\\nPassenger #1: Uhm, what was that?\\nRachel: Oh, that was just my crazy friend. She told me I should get \\n  off the plane, because she had a feeling that there was something \\n  wrong with the left Philange.\\nPassenger #1: Okay, that doesn\\'t sound good.\\nRachel: I wouldn\\'t worry about it. She\\'s always coming up with stuff \\n  like this, and you know what? She\\'s almost never right.\\nPassenger #1: But she is sometimes.\\nRachel: Well...\\n(The passenger stands up and gets his suitcase from the overhead \\n  compartment.)\\nRachel: Wait, what are you doing?\\nPassenger #1: Well, I can\\'t take this plane now.\\nAir stewardess: Excuse me, sir, where are you going?\\nPassenger #1: I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a \\n  feeling something\\'s wrong with the left Philange.\\nRachel: Could I get some peanuts?\\nPassenger #2: What\\'s wrong with the plane?\\nAir stewardess: There\\'s nothing wrong with the plane.\\nPassenger #1: Yeah! The left Philange!\\nAir stewardess: There is no Philange!\\nPassenger #1: Oh my God. This plane doesn\\'t even have a Philange!\\nPassenger #2: I\\'m not flying on it!\\nAir stewardess: Ma\\'am, please sit down!\\nPassenger #3: What\\'s going on?\\nPassenger #1: We\\'re all getting off. There is no Philange!\\n(Everybody walks out of the plane.)\\nRachel: This is ridiculous! I...\\n(She notices that everybody is leaving.)\\nRachel: Yeah, okay.\\n(Rachel leaves as well.)\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: Joey\\'s apartment. Monica has completely destroyed the \\n  foosball-table, and Chandler and Joey are holding the birds.]\\nMonica: Alright. My job here is done.\\nChandler: That was... Impressive.\\nJoey: Yeah, you didn\\'t even use the tools for most of it!\\nMonica: Yeah, they were just slowing me down. Alright, I have to get \\n  back to the babies. I\\'ll see you girls later.\\n(Monica leaves.)\\nChandler: Sorry about the table, man.\\nJoey: Yeah.\\nChandler: You gonna buy a new one?\\nJoey: Probably not. Nah. I don\\'t know how much I\\'m gonna wanna play \\n  after you go.\\nChandler: Well, at least we got these little guys out.\\nJoey: Yeah.\\nChandler: Aww, we were worried about you! Hm. I guess I better get \\n  used to things crapping in my hand, huh?\\nJoey: I\\'m gonna miss these little guys. It was nice having birds \\n  around again.\\nChandler: Hey, you know what? Maybe we should keep them here with you.\\nJoey: What?\\nChandler: Yeah, I mean we\\'ve got a lot going on right now. And, plus, \\n  here they\\'d have their own room.\\nJoey: I could get a goose!\\nChandler: You know, I - I think you\\'re set with the poultry.\\nJoey: Thanks man. Did you hear that, you guys? You\\'re gonna get to \\n  stay here! And, and it\\'s good, you know, \\'cause, \\'cause now you have a \\n  reason to come visit.\\nChandler: I think there may be another reason. So, awkward hug or lame \\n  cool guy handshake?\\nJoey: Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.\\n(They do the lame cool guy handshake. They look at each other, and \\nthen they hug.) \\n\\xa0 \\n[Scene: The gate at the airport. The passengers are standing in line, \\n  and they\\'re about to board the plane again.]\\nGate attendant #2: Ma\\'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.\\nPassenger #2: And you fixed the Philange?\\nGate attendant #2: Yes, the Philange is fixed. As a matter of fact, we \\n  put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.\\n(Rachel walks up to the gate. Cut to Ross and Phoebe who come running up to the gate.)\\nRoss: Where is she?\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t see her.\\nRoss: Rachel! Rachel Green!\\nPhoebe: There she is!\\nRoss: Rachel!

Everything\\'s packed.\\nChandler: Wow, this is weird.\\nMonica: I know.\\nJoey: Yeah. Uh, does this mean there\\'s nothing to eat?\\nMonica: I put three lasagnas in your freezer.\\nJoey: I love you!\\n(He hugs her. Phoebe enters.)\\nJoey: Hey!\\nPhoebe: Hey.\\nJoey: So did you guys make it in time?\\nPhoebe: Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.\\nChandler: Where\\'s Ross?\\nPhoebe: He went home. He didn\\'t want to see anybody.\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: Ross\\'s apartment. Ross enters and checks his messages.]\\nRachel: (on the answering machine) Ross, hi. It\\'s me. I just got back \\n  on the plane. And I just feel awful. That is so not how I wanted \\n  things to end with us. It\\'s just that I wasn\\'t expecting to see you, \\n  and all of a sudden you\\'re there and saying these things... And... And \\n  now I\\'m just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff I should have \\n  said, and I didn\\'t. I mean, I didn\\'t even get to tell you that I love \\n  you too. Because of course I do. I love you. I love you. I love you. \\n  What am I doing? I love you! Oh, I\\'ve gotta see you. I\\'ve gotta get \\n  off this plane.\\nRoss: Oh my God!\\nRachel: (on the answering machine) Excuse me?\\nAir stewardess: (on the answering machine) Miss? Please, sit down!\\nRachel: (on the answering machine) I\\'m sorry. I\\'m really sorry, but I \\n  need to get off the plane, okay? I need to tell someone that I love \\n  love them.\\nAir stewardess: (on the answering machine) Miss, I can\\'t let you off \\n  the plane.\\nRoss: Let her off the plane!\\nAir stewardess: (on the answering machine) I am afraid you are gonna \\n  have to take a seat.\\nRachel: (on the answering machine) Oh, please, miss, you don\\'t \\n  understand!\\nRoss: Try to understand!\\nRachel: (on the answering machine) Oh, come on, miss, isn\\'t there any \\n  way that you can just let me off...\\n(The message is finished. Ross jumps over to the answering machine.)\\nRoss: No! No! Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? Did she get off \\n  the plane?\\nRachel: I got off the plane.\\nRoss: You got off the plane.\\n(He walks over and kisses her.)\\nRachel: I do love you.\\nRoss: I love you too, and I\\'m never letting you go again.\\nRachel: Okay. \\'Cause this is where I wanna be, okay? No more messing \\n  around. I don\\'t wanna mess this up again.\\nRoss: Me neither, okay? We are - we\\'re done being stupid.\\nRachel: Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.\\nRoss: This is it. Unless we\\'re on a break.\\n(Rachel gives him a look.)\\nRoss: Don\\'t make jokes now.\\n(They kiss again.)\\n\\xa0\\n[Scene: Monica and Chandler\\'s apartment. Chandler and Monica are \\n  holding the twins. Joey and Phoebe are sitting by the window, while \\n  Ross and Rachel are standing together. The apartment is completely \\n  empty. Two men are carrying a large dresser.]\\nMonica: Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother\\'s. Be \\n  careful.\\n(Two other men are rolling the big white dog out of the apartment.)\\nMonica: If that falls off the truck, it wouldn\\'t be the worst thing.\\n(She slips them some money.)\\nRoss: Wow.\\nRachel: I know. It seems smaller somehow.\\nJoey: Has it always been purple?\\nChandler: (to his children) Look around, you guys. This was your first \\n  home. And it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. But \\n  more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin\\' steal!\\n(Monica and Chandler put Jack and Erica in their stroller.)\\nPhoebe: Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived \\n  in this apartment?\\nMonica: Oh, yeah, that\\'s true.\\nRoss: Uh, I haven\\'t.\\nMonica: Wait a minute. What about that summer during college that you \\n  lived with grandma, and you tried to make it as a dancer?\\nRoss: Do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming \\n  up?\\nMonica: Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we\\'d leave our \\n  keys.\\nChandler: Oh, okay.\\n(Chandler and Monica walk over to the kitchen-counter and leave their \\n  keys. Then the other four pick out their keys and leave them as well.)\\nPhoebe: So, I guess this is it.\\nJoey: Yeah. I guess so.\\nMonica: (crying) This is harder than I thought it would be.\\nChandler: Oh, it\\'s gonna be okay.\\n(Chandler hugs her. Monica hugs Ross and Rachel as Chandler gets the stroller with the \\n  twins.)\\nRachel: (crying) Do you guys have to go to the new house right away, \\n  or do you have some time?\\nMonica: We got some time.\\nRachel: Okay, should we get some coffee?\\nChandler: Sure. Where?\\n(They all leave the apartment. Joey helps Chandler with the stroller \\n  in the hallway, while Monica and Rachel have their arms around each \\n  other. Everybody walks downstairs to Central Perk. The camera goes \\n  inside the apartment again, and it pans around. We see the keys on the \\n  counter, and the final shot is of the frame around the peephole. The \\n  screen fades to black.)\\nTHE END \\n                 \\n                        \\nCrazy For Friends is best viewed at \\n  800x600 with Internet Explorer 6.0.

Happy birthday ...\\nRachel: Shhh don\\'t say that loud, Gunther\\'s gonna want to hug me.\\nRoss: Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly \\n  (points to Molly).

You really think she\\'s hot?\\nChandler: Are you kidding?

Oh!\\nPhoebe: What?\\nMike: OK, I don\\'t want to freak you out or anything, but I think I just \\n  saw a rat in your cupboard.\\nPhoebe: (relived) Oh, whew, no, that\\'s Bob.\\nMike: What, is he your pet rat?\\nPhoebe: Well not so much a pet as, you know, an occasional visitor who \\n  I put food out for, you know. Kinda like Santa. Except Santa doesn\\'t poop on \\n  the plate of cookies.\\nMike: You can\\'t keep a rat in your appartment! They\\'re extremely unsanitary, \\n  and they transmit leptospirosis and hantavirus.\\nPhoebe: What are those?\\nMike: I don\\'t know but they don\\'t sound like spa treatments. You have \\n  to get rid of it!\\nPhoebe: OK, fine, if it means that much to you I\\'ll get rid of Bob.\\nMike: Thank you.\\nPhoebe: So weird, you think he\\'s so gross and you\\'re willing to eat \\n  his crackers.

I really owe you an appology.\\nGavin: For what?\\nRachel: Well, when we first met, you know, I thought you were pompous \\n  and arrogant and obnoxious ...\\nGavin: Is this your first appology?\\nRachel: No, I just mean that, you know, first impressions don\\'t mean \\n  anything. And I-I think you\\'re a really good guy and I\\'m sorry that I misjudged \\n  you.\\n(Heather walks in)\\nHeather: Good morning! \\nRachel: Hello. (to Gavin) But you know what, hey, new day, new leaf, \\n  I am just really really happy ... (sees Gavin staring at Heather) I\\'m sorry, \\n  obviously Heather\\'s ass has something more important to say so I\\'ll just wait \\n  \\'till it\\'s finished.\\nGavin: What?\\nRachel: I was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her \\n  out!\\nGavin: I wasn\\'t checking her out. I\\'m in fashion, I was looking at her \\n  skirt. Or was it pants? I didn\\'t really see what happened below the ass area.\\nRachel: Oh wow, you are really, you\\'re really a creep.\\nGavin: Why do you even care if I was looking at her? Are you jealous?\\nRachel: Oh yeah, I\\'m jealous. \"Oh Gavin, please, please look at \\n  my ass\". (Gavin starts looking) Stop looking at my ass! I mean, I just \\n  think you are totally inappropriate, ok? This is a work environment, she\\'s your \\n  subordinate.\\nGavin: I thought it was ok when you slept with your old assistant Tag.\\nRachel: That is totally different for two reasons. One - I didn\\'t know \\n  that you knew that. And two, I wasn\\'t some creep staring at his ass, we had \\n  a deap meaningful relationship.\\nGavin: Huh. What\\'s Tag\\'s last name?\\nRachel: It was ... (can\\'t remember) oh my god. He didn\\'t have a last \\n  name. It was just \"Tag\". You know, like Cher, or, you know, Moses.\\nGavin: But it was a deap meaningful relationship.\\nRachel: Oh, you know what - my first impression of you was absolutely \\n  right. You are arrogant, you are pompous ... Morgan! Morgan! Tag\\'s last name \\n  was Morgan! Huh!\\nGavin: It was Jones.\\nRachel: Yeah well what are you, his boyfriend?\\n[Scene: Coffee place, Molly holding Emma and talking to Joey]\\nJoey: Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.\\nMolly: You mean, when you were a baby.\\nJoey: Sure.\\n(Chandler is staring at Molly)\\nMonica: Would you stop staring at her?\\nChandler: I wasn\\'t staring. I was leering.\\nMonica: What\\'s the big deal with her? Maybe she\\'s attractive in an obvious \\n  kind of way.\\nRoss: Yeah, obvious beauty\\'s the worst. You know, when it\\'s right there \\n  in your face. Me, I like to have to work to find someone attractive. Makes me \\n  feel like I earned it.\\nChandler: Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.\\nMonica: Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey \\n  get the girl for once.\\nMolly: (to Ross) I\\'m gonna take her back to the appartment.\\nRoss: Ok, I\\'ll be home right after work. Ok, by Emma-Wemma-Demma, I \\n  love you - wovyou dovyou ...\\nMolly: Bye\\nMonica: They\\'ve elected me to talk to you about the baby talk - it\\'s \\n  not so good.\\nMolly: I think it\\'s sweet. (goes to leave)\\nRoss, Joey and Chandler: Bye, Emma-Wemma-Demma.\\nRachel: (to Joey) Hey, listen, Joey, about Molly, I really prefer if \\n  you didn\\'t go after her.\\nJoey: Why not?\\nRachel: Because it took us months to find a good nanny and I wouldn\\'t \\n  want anything to, you know, drive her away.\\nJoey: So, what, you think I\\'m just gonna sleep with her and never call \\n  her again and things are gonna get uncomfortable? (thinks about it) Yeah, sounds \\n  about right.\\nRoss: Come on, there are plenty of other women out thereok? Just - just \\n  forget about her, ok? Just, she\\'s off limits.\\nJoey: Oh, man, why did have to go and say that for? Now that you told \\n  me I can\\'t have it makes me want her even more!\\nRoss: What are you, a child?\\nJoey: Yes!\\nRoss: Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just-just try to focus your \\n  sexual energy on someone else.\\nJoey: Fine. (looks around, then focuses on Monica)\\nMonica: (to Chandler) Take me home! (they quickly leave)\\n[Scene: Phoebe\\'s place, Phoebe and Mike are there]\\nPhoebe: Hey Mikey\\nMike: Hey P\\nPhoebe: What are you doing?\\nMike: Setting rat traps.\\nPhoebe: To kill Bob??\\nMike: No, no, to test his neck strength.\\nPhoebe: No, Mike, I don\\'t want to kill him! I thought we were just gonna \\n  capture him and, and you know, set him free in the country side where he can \\n  maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl.\\nMike: Ok, ok, I\\'ll throw away the traps.\\nPhoebe: I\\'ll find Bob, I\\'ll get him. Bob? (starts looking) Bob! Robert! \\n  (looks at cabinet under sink) Oh wait, I think I hear him. Oh - Oh my god! Bob \\n  had babies! Bob\\'s a mom!\\nMike: Better think of a new name for him.\\nPhoebe: I don\\'t know, I kinda like Bob for a girl.\\nMike: I don\\'t know, I mean I\\'m not sure (they hear cracking voice from \\n  somewhere else in the kitchen, probably a rat caught in a trap) ...\\nPhoebe: Oh my god, we killed Bob!\\nMike: Maybe it wasn\\'t Bob, maybe it was a mouse.\\nPhoebe: Suzie? (Runs over there to check)\\n[Scene: Mon and Chan\\'s, Ross enters]\\nRoss: Whazzup??\\nChandler: Seriously dude, 3 years ago.\\nRoss: Listen, can you do me a favor? I\\'m gonna be out today. Can you \\n  just keep an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?\\nChandler: You don\\'t trust him?\\nRoss: Wh - No. Some woman who sounded a lot like Joey called earlier \\n  and asked for her daughter, the \"hot nanny\".\\nChandler: Is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference? \\n  Because I could get a job any day now.\\nRoss: You do appear right on the cusp of something. Come on man, I\\'m \\n  sure he\\'ll lose interest in a week or two, but for now can you please just do \\n  this for me?\\nChandler: Allright, fine, but don\\'t blame me if it doesn\\'t work. Because \\n  you know as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often \\n  than not, he\\'s going to have sex with it.\\nRoss: Well we gotta do something, ok? Nannies like her don\\'t grow on \\n  trees. (pause) \\nChandler: Picturing that tree?\\nRoss: I am, yes.\\n[Scene: Hallway, Joey get out of his appartment and Chandler jumps out of \\n  his]\\nChandler: Where you going, Joe?\\n(Joey falls on floor and gets up)\\nJoey: For a walk.\\nChandler: Oh. You mind if I join you?\\nJoey: Actually, that will be long. You know, I really need to organize \\n  my thoughts.\\nChandler: Your thoughts? Plural?\\nJoey: Allright, fine, I only have one thought! It\\'s about the hot nanny, \\n  I gotta see her!\\nChandler: I\\'m afraid I can\\'t let you do that, Joe.\\nJoey: Now YOU\\'RE telling me I can\\'t see her?? You guys are killing me! \\n  She\\'s forbidden fruit! It\\'s like ... like she\\'s the princess and I\\'m the stable \\n  boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over \\n  there?\\nChandler: Yes, as a matter of fact he did, so I can\\'t let you go.\\nJoey: Huh. Interesting. Now there are obstacles. Hot nanny and me against \\n  the world. This is the kind of stuff great novels are made of.\\nChandler: Great novels? \\nJoey: Fine ... mediocre porn\\n[Scene: Rachel\\'s office, Rachel and Gavin there, phone rings, Gavin picks \\n  it up]\\nGavin: Gavin Mitchelle\\'s office.\\nRachel: Rachel Green\\'s office!! Give me that phone! (takes the phone) \\n  Hello, this is Rachel Green, how can I help you? Uh huh ... ok then ... I\\'ll \\n  pass you back to your son (gives phone to Gavin)\\nGavin: Hey Mom! No, that\\'s just my secretary. (Rachel is upset)\\nRachel: Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you.\\nGavin: Mom, I\\'ll call you later. Yeah. (hangs up) (to Rachel) Yes?\\nRachel: If you like looking at butts so much why don\\'t you just go look \\n  at a mirror?\\nGavin: Thank god you finally said that, I saw you make a note on your \\n  pad three hours ago. (Rachel throws away that paper) Man, I really bug you, \\n  don\\'t I?\\nRachel: Oh, please, I don\\'t care about you enough to bug me. In fact, \\n  from now on, I\\'m going take the high road. And I\\'m going be very very nice to \\n  you, you \"momma\\'s boy\", starting right now.\\n(door knock, Monica enters)\\nMonica: Hey Rach!\\nRachel: Hi!\\nMonica: Ready for your birthday lunch?\\nRachel: Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like \\n  to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful \\n  friend Gavin Mitchelle. \\nGavin: Pleased to meet you.\\nMonica: Pleased to meet you. So you\\'re coming to Rachel\\'s party tonight?\\nRachel: Oh no no no no no, Gavin can\\'t, he already has plans, most likely \\n  with his mother. \\nGavin: Well I don\\'t mind, I\\'ll cancel. I would never miss my secretary\\'s \\n  birthday. (leaves)\\nRachel: Why did you invite him?? I can\\'t stand that guy!\\nMonica: You were just being so nice to him!\\nRachel: I was faking it! Can\\'t you tell when I\\'m being fake?\\n(A man walks by)\\nRachel: Hey, Mr Philips, nice suit!\\nMonica: Right there! That was so fake!\\nRachel: Shh!\\n[Scene: Rachel\\'s birthday party]\\nRachel: (to Monica) I still can\\'t believe you invited Gavin. Allright, \\n  he is the last person I want to see.\\nMonica: Oh, you\\'re welcome for the party. I\\'m glad you\\'re having a good \\n  time.\\nRachel: God, I hope he doesn\\'t show up. Of course he\\'s not gonna show \\n  up, the guy hates me.\\nMonica: Does he?\\nRachel: What?\\nMonica: Maybe he\\'s bothering you so much because he likes you. It\\'s \\n  like in first grade when Skippy Langwild always pushed me on the playground \\n  because he secretly had a crush on me?\\nRachel: Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys \\n  had a bet to see if he can knock you over.\\nMolly: (with Emma in a basinet) She\\'s out, I\\'m gonna take her home.\\nRachel: Oh, ok, thank you. (Molly leaves) (to Monica) Do you see what \\n  all the guys see in her?\\nMonica: Wouldn\\'t kick her out of bed. No more Vodka for me!

(sees Molly leaving) oh, \\n  see you later (runs after Molly)\\nMonica: Hey Rach, somebody got you shoes!\\nRachel: Oh, give me! (opens the box happily, then gets freaked and throws \\n  away the box, she and Mon jump up the sofa)\\nPhoebe: Be careful, be careful! These are my rat babies!\\nMike: Yeah. We have rat babies now.\\nRachel: Ahhhh , you brought rats to my birthday party?\\nMonica: So this is what a stroke feels like.\\nPhoebe: I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they\\'re our responsibility \\n  now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you\\'re \\n  a mother.\\nRachel: Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?\\nPhoebe: No! Seven rats! I think we should take them home, we need feed \\n  them.\\nRachel: whhh wait, you\\'re gonna leave my party to take care of a box \\n  of rats?\\nPhoebe: Well I\\'m sorry Rachel, but I\\'m not like you, ok? Not everyone \\n  can afford help. (she and Mike leave)\\n(Ross gets out of the bathroom, sees Chandler)\\nRoss: Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.\\nChandler: (In a helium voice, holding a balloon) I\\'m sorry, I got a \\n  little occupied.\\nRoss: We have to stop them before something happens!\\nChandler: (still helium voice) Right behind you, big guy! (they both \\n  head for the door) \\n[Scene: Ross\\'s place, Molly and Joey are talking on the couch]\\nJoey: So you see, Molly, what people don\\'t understand is that acting \\n  is a discipline. It takes a lot of hard work.\\nMolly: So where did you study?\\nJoey: Oh, I didn\\'t go to college.\\nMolly: No, where did you study acting?\\nJoey: Molly ... people don\\'t study acting ...\\n(Ross and Chandler walk in, Joey looks disappointed)\\nRoss: Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?\\nMolly: Sure, I\\'ll go check on Emma.\\nRoss: Thanx.\\n(Molly gets up and walks away)\\nJoey: (upset) Will the stable boy never get the princess??\\nRoss: What do you think you\\'re gonna do, have sex with her right here \\n  on my couch?\\nJoey: No ... the leather sticks to my ass. You know, this isn\\'t fair. \\n  What makes you think that I\\'m just gonna sleep with her and then blow her off? \\n  Huh? Can\\'t you guys open your minds to the possibility that I actally like her, \\n  and might want something real? (pause) Look, the truth is, I haven\\'t felt this \\n  way about anyone since Rachel, ok? I didn\\'t think I could ever love again.\\n(pause)\\nRoss and Chandler: Come on! Joe!\\nJoey: Ok (admits)\\n(knock on door, Ross opens, it\\'s a woman)\\nWoman: Hi, is Molly here?\\nRoss: Yeah, come on in. Molly?\\nMolly: (goes out of the room) Hey! Guys, this is Tabatha (they kiss \\n  on the lips in a romantic way). (to Ross) I\\'ll see you tomorrow.\\nRoss: Ok ... (they leave the room, long pause) Well, uh, Joey, I guess \\n  we have no problem.\\nJoey: It\\'s like my favorite fairy tale come true! (Chandler looks at \\n  him) The princess, the stable boy and the lesbian!\\n[Scene: Phoebe\\'s place, Phoebe and Mike enter]\\nPhoebe: Ok, ok, you start preparing the formula and I start changing \\n  the box and then we gotta put them straight to bed.\\nMike: Hey, when did we become one of those couples whose lives revolve \\n  around their rats?\\nPhoebe: Well, you know what, they\\'re our responsibility now.\\nMike: Ok, fine, these rats are our responsibility. What happens when \\n  they mate and there are hundreds of them?\\nPhoebe: Mate? They\\'re all brothers and sisters.\\nMike: Yeah - not such a problem with rats. No, they\\'re more of a \"love \\n  the one you\\'re with\" kind of animals.\\nPhoebe: No. (opens the box) wh - get off your sister! Oh my god, what \\n  are we gonna do? We have 7 rats. So what if each of them has 7 rats? And then \\n  each of those have 7 rats? That\\'s like ... (starts counting with her fingers) \\n  That\\'s math I can\\'t even do! What are we gonna do?\\nMike: Well, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but, we could not let \\n  the box of rats ruin our lives.\\nPhoebe: Yeah, ok. I guess you\\'re right. Allright, so we should just \\n  give them away. But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. \\n  They\\'re Bob\\'s favorites. \\nMike: It\\'s gonna be ok.\\nPhoebe: You must think I\\'m crazy.\\nMike: No, I think you\\'re sweet.\\nPhoebe: Good. It\\'s just so hard, it\\'s hard for me to ... let them go. \\n  I guess it just brings back memories, you know, from ... when I gave birth to \\n  my brother\\'s triplets and I had to give them up. (Mike is shocked) I haven\\'t \\n  told you about that yet, have I?\\n[Scene: Rachel\\'s party, Rachel is on the balcony, Monica goes there also]\\nMonica: Hey!\\nRachel: Hi. Thanks for the party, honey. Should I help you clean up?\\nMonica: No way! You had your party, now I have mine! Is everything alright?\\nRachel: Yeah, I just get a little bummed when my birthday\\'s over.\\nMonica: Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk \\n  Gavin from your office didn\\'t show up (Gavin shows up at the balcony windows).\\nRachel: Mmm hmm.\\nGavin: Yeah, hey. (comes in to the balcony)\\nMonica: Oh, we weren\\'t talking about you. No, no way to recover.\\nRachel: No.\\n(Monica goes back inside)\\nGavin: Nice party.\\nRachel: Well, it was, and you would have seen it if you didn\\'t showed \\n  up at (looks at his watch) ... 9:30?? God! Oh, this party was lame ...\\nMonica: (from inside) Again, you\\'re welcome.\\nGavin: Look, I\\'ll just give you this and go.\\nRachel: Oh, you bought me a present! Why?\\nGavin: Well, let me explain how birthday parties usually work. There \\n  are presents, and a cake, perhaps a fourth or fifth person. Ok, I ... got you \\n  the present to make up for being such a jerk to you earlier.\\nRachel: Aww. Well, ok, well that\\'s very nice. And you wrote a card (opens \\n  the card). \"From Gavin\"\\nGavin: I really mean it.\\nRachel: (opens the present, it\\'s a green scarf) Awww, awww, it\\'s beautiful.\\nGavin: You don\\'t mind? (puts it around her neck) Well, what do you know, \\n  it fits!\\nRachel: See, Gavin, you\\'re capable of being a nice guy. Why did you \\n  give me such a hard time?\\nGavin: I\\'m not sure.\\nRachel: Well Monica seems to think it\\'s because you have feelings for \\n  me.\\nGavin: I do have feelings for you.\\nRachel: You do?\\nGavin: Yes, I feel that you are a little annoying.\\nRachel: See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I\\'m about to change my opinion \\n  of you, you go and you ... (he kisses her) and you do that ...

And your license expired. \\n\\nRachel: I know. (Starts to cry) Yeah, see, there’s so much to do and I have\\nso little time to do it in.\\n\\nClosing Credits\\n\\n[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are reading a book about things to do\\nwhilst in London.]\\n\\nChandler: All right, check it out.

We just live in the same building.\\n\\nChandler: Any contact?\\n\\nRoss: She lent me an egg once.\\n\\nJoey: You\\'re in!\\n\\nRoss: Aw, right.\\n\\nWoman: Hi, Ross.\\n\\nRoss: Hey. (stutters something incoherent)\\n\\nChandler: Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel\\nthing\\'s not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian—I don\\'t think we need a third... \\n\\nJoey: Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks.\\n\\nRoss: An egg?\\n\\nJoey: Yeah, you\\'re gonna go up to her and say, \"Here\\'s your egg back, I\\'m\\nreturning your egg.\"\\n\\nChandler: I think it\\'s winning.\\n\\nRoss: I think it\\'s insane.\\n\\nChandler: She\\'ll love it. Go with the egg, my friend.\\n\\n(Ross walks over to the woman, egg in hand.)\\n\\nJoey: Think it\\'ll work?\\n\\nChandler: No, it\\'s suicide.

The only reason she\\'s goin\\' out\\nwith me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend.\\n\\nChandler: Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a...\\n\\nJoey: Pathetic mess? I know, but—come on, man, she\\'s needy, she\\'s\\nvulnerable. I\\'m thinkin\\', cha-ching! (Rachel throws a roll at Joey. He picks it up and\\neats it.) Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You\\'re doin\\'\\nthis.\\n\\nRoss: Hi. She said yes.\\n\\nChandler: Yes! Way to go, man! (Chandler and Ross hug.

Very nice.\\n\\nChandler: ...And what did you bring?\\n\\nLorraine: She\\'s checking the coats. Joey, I\\'m gonna go wash the cab smell off my\\nhands.

Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had\\nsex. (imitating) \"Was it good for you?\"\\n\\nMonica: Yeah, well, I\\'ll take a little crying any day over\\nHoward-the-\"I-win\"-guy. (imitating) \"I win! I win!\" I went out with\\nthe guy for two months—I didn\\'t get to win once.\\n\\nRachel: How did we end up with these jerks? We\\'re good people!\\n\\nMonica: I don\\'t know. Maybe we\\'re some kinda magnets.\\n\\nPhoebe: I know I am. That\\'s why I can\\'t wear a digital watch.\\n\\nMonica: There\\'s more beer, right?\\n\\nPhoebe: Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you\\nwant to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual.\\n\\nRachel: Pheebes, this woman is voluntarily bald.\\n\\nPhoebe: Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It\\'s Valentine\\'s Day.\\nIt\\'s perfect.\\n\\nMonica: Ok, well, what kind of ritual?\\n\\nPhoebe: Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us.\\n\\nRachel: Or?\\n\\nPhoebe: Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks.\\n\\nMonica: Burning\\'s good.\\n\\nRachel: Burning\\'s good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn.\\n\\n[Scene: The Restaurant, Joey, Lorraine, Chandler, and Janice are at the table.

(jumps suddenly) Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?\\n\\nJanice: By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want,\\nI have a bag with just your heads.\\n\\nChandler: That\\'s OK.\\n\\nJanice: Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little\\npuppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty.\\n\\n(Lorraine whispers into Joey\\'s ear.)\\n\\nJoey: (to Lorraine) We can\\'t do that.\\n\\nChandler: (disgusted) What? What can\\'t you do?\\n\\nJoey: Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?\\n\\n(Chandler and Joey leave the table.)\\n\\nJoey: Uh, we might be leaving now.\\n\\nChandler: Tell me it\\'s \"you and me\" we.\\n\\nJoey: She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off.

You\\'re right.\\n\\nLorraine: (to waiter) Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?\\n\\nJoey: I\\'m outta here. Here\\'s my credit card. Dinner\\'s on me.

(gets up, jumps up and down while he zips his zipper up...\\nother patrons look at him) How ya doin\\'?\\n\\nJanice: So, do we have the best friends or what?\\n\\nChandler: Joey\\'s not a friend.

(to\\nChandler) He just happened to call.\\n\\nJanice: Hi, Ross. Yes, it\\'s me. How did you know? (she laughs obnoxiously) \\n\\n[Scene: A Chinese Restaurant, Ross is there with his date.]\\n\\nRoss: I\\'m just sayin\\' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole\\num, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los\\nAngeles, he doesn\\'t just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half.\\n\\n(Ross starts to laugh, and then makes a face like \\'Why did I just say that?\\' Ross\\'\\nex-wife, Carol, and her lesbian lover, Susan, enter the restaurant. Ross stares at them.)\\n\\nKristin: That\\'s funny. Who are they?\\n\\nRoss: The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close,\\npersonal friend.\\n\\nKristin: You mean they\\'re lovers.\\n\\nRoss: If you wanna put a label on it.\\n\\nKristin: Wow, uh, anything else I should know?\\n\\nRoss: Nope, nope, that\\'s it. \\n\\n(Carol takes off her jacket, her pregnant belly is exposed.)\\n\\nRoss: Oh, and she\\'s pregnant with my baby.

Susan gets up, and has to go. Carol is left\\nstranded)...which is funny because, that wasn\\'t even my major.\\n\\nCarol: Oh no. I thought you said they could shoot the spot without you. \\n\\nSusan: I thought they could...I\\'ll try to get back as soon as I can. I\\'m sorry.\\n(Ross realizes Kristin was expecting him to laugh, so he starts to laugh hysterically.)\\n\\nRoss: Now that is funny.

Oh, little candy hearts. (reading the candy) Chan and\\nJan Forever.\\n\\nJanice: I had them made special.\\n\\nChandler: Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there\\'s no way for me to tell\\nyou this. At least there\\'s no new way for me to tell you this. I just don\\'t things\\nare gonna work out.\\n\\nJanice: That\\'s fine.\\n\\nChandler: (surprised) It is?\\n\\nJanice: Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn\\'t the end.\\n\\nChandler: Oh no, you see, actually it is.\\n\\nJanice: No, it isn\\'t, because you won\\'t let that happen. Don\\'t you know it yet?\\nYou love me, Chandler Bing.\\n\\nChandler: Oh, no I don\\'t.\\n\\nJanice: Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up\\ntogether? New Year\\'s? Who invited who? Valentine\\'s? Who asked who into whose bed? \\n\\nChandler: I did, but...\\n\\nJanice: You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a\\nfoghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can\\'t live without me. And you know\\nit. You just don\\'t know you know it. See ya.\\n\\n(She kisses him passionately,then leaves.)\\n\\nChandler: Call me!\\n\\n[Scene: The Chinese Restaurant, Ross and Carol are talking. Kristin is not there.]\\n\\nCarol: It\\'s not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.\\n\\nRoss: You did so. I swear, I swear—(noticing Kristin\\'s absence) How long\\nhas she been in the bathroom?\\n\\nCarol: Uh, I don\\'t think she\\'s in the bathroom. Her coat is gone.\\n\\nRoss: Well maybe it\\'s cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had\\nin 9 years. \\n\\nCarol: That could be it.\\n\\nRoss: Oh, god. (He puts his head down on the grill) You know, this is still\\npretty hot. (He picks his head up, and a mushroom sticks to his head. Carol picks it off\\nand eats it.)\\n\\nCarol: Mushroom. Smile. They won\\'t all be like this. Some women might even stay\\nthrough dinner. Sorry, that\\'s not funny\\n\\nRoss: No, it\\'s just...you know the whole \"getting on with your life\"\\nthing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I\\'m sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and\\nshe\\'s perfectly nice, and, but that there\\'s, that\\'s it. And um, and then I\\'m here talkin\\'\\nto you, and, and it\\'s easy, and it\\'s fun, and, and I don\\'t, I don\\'t have to...You know,\\nhere\\'s a wacky thought. Um, what\\'s say you and I give it another shot? No no no, I know\\nwhat you\\'re gonna say, you\\'re a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for\\nnow you know? Let\\'s just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we\\'re great together, you know.\\nYou can\\'t deny it. Besides, you\\'re carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see,\\nyou know, you keep sayin\\' that, but there\\'s somethin\\' right here. I love you.\\n\\n(They kiss.)\\n\\nCarol: Oh, I love you too. But...\\n\\nRoss: No but, no but.\\n\\nCarol: You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It\\'s time to\\ntake the pin out. You\\'ll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting\\nfor you.\\n\\nRoss: That\\'s easy for you to say, you found one already.\\n\\nCarol: All you need is a woman who likes men and you\\'ll be set.\\n\\n(A beautiful woman walks by Ross, he stares at her.)\\n\\nCarol: Not her.\\n\\nClosing Credits\\n\\n[Scene: Monica and Rachel\\'s, The girls are talking with the firemen.]\\n\\nFireman No. 3: We get off around midnight, why don\\'t we pick you up then?\\n\\nRachel: So, um, will you bring the truck?\\n\\nFireman No. 3: I\\'ll even let you ring the bell.\\n\\nRachel: Oh, my god.\\n\\nPhoebe: See, there you go, the cleansing works!\\n\\nMonica: They\\'re nice guys.\\n\\nRachel: Oh, they\\'re firemen guys.\\n\\n[Scene: Out in the hall, the firemen are talking.]\\n\\nFireman No. 1: You guys tell them you were married?\\n\\nFireman No. 2: No way!\\n\\nFireman No. 3: Are you kidding?
